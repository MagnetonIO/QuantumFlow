# QuantumFlow  
**QuantumFlow** is a Python library designed for simulating **derived Hamiltonians** across multiple domains, including:  
- **Quantum Field Theory (QFT)** in curved spacetime.  
- **Molecular Dynamics and Protein Folding** (Biophysics).  
- **Quantum Circuits** using tensor-based Hamiltonians.  
- **Lattice QCD** simulations with higher-order corrections.  

QuantumFlow leverages cutting-edge tools like **JAX, PyTorch, Qiskit, and Plotly** to provide real-time visualizations and efficient simulations.
